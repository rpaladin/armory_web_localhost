# Prerequisites

1. `Windows` or `Linux` OS<br />
Feel free to adapt the provided commandline scripts to fit any non-mentioned operating-systems.

2. **Python 3.0+**<br />
Blender ships with Python and can be found in: `Blender\2.93\python\bin`

# Setup

1. Download and extract the scripts in this repository.

2. Modify the file-paths in any of the runnable commandline scripts to fit your local file-structure.

3. Run the commandline script once everything is setup properly.

4. Type in `localhost` or `localhost:80` in a browser URL address.<br />
**NOTE:** If port `80` is already in use, you will need to change the port value in `Localhost_&_Redirects.py` to another number.

# Special Thanks

Special thanks to @sus-impost0r for converting the `Windows CMD` commandline script to `Linux SH`!
